I am developing a Flutter application that will serve as a reader/browser/downloader for eBooks created from fanfiction works. The application will be designed to work with works from various sources, such as Archive of Our Own (AO3), FanFiction.net, and others. The primary goal is to provide a seamless reading experience while allowing users to manage their library of works effectively.

I am utilizing a feature-first architecture for the application, which means that each feature will be developed as a separate module with its own functionality. This will allow for better organization of the codebase and easier maintenance in the long run. The application will be structured around the following features:

-   Main Screen: Bottom navigation between the following features:
    -   Library: A page to view all works in the application
        -   Details: A page to view detailed information about a work
            -   This will include metadata such as title, author(s), fandom(s), series, published date, updated/completed date, cover image, and a list of chapters
            -   Users can open the work in the reader from this page
            -   Users can bookmark chapters, highlight text, and view detailed information about each chapter
        -   Reader: A page to read works from their corresponding file
            -   Users can navigate through chapters, bookmark chapters, highlight text, and view detailed information about the work
            -   Users can choose between different reading modes (vertical scrolling, horizontal scrolling, page-by-page, infinite scrolling)
            -   Users can view a table of contents (TOC) for the work
            -   Users can view a list of bookmarks and highlights for the work
            -   Users can view indicators for words/phrases that have more information available (similar to Kindle's "X-Ray" feature)
            -   Users can view an options bar (configurable in More -> Settings -> Reader)
                -   Options will include:
                    -   Screen Orientation
                    -   Theme Mode (Light/Dark/Auto)
                    -   Player Mode (future feature to allow text-to-speech reading of the work)
                    -   Auto-Scroll (future feature to allow automatic scrolling of the work)
                    -   Bookmarks (to view a list of bookmarks for the work)
                    -   X-Ray (to view a list of indicators for words/phrases in the work)
                    -   Brightness (to adjust the brightness of the reader, can also be adjusted by dragging up/down on the left/right side of the screen (configurable in preferences))
                    -   Font Size (to adjust the font size of the reader, can also be adjusted by pinching in/out on the screen)
                    -   Search (to search for text in the work)
                    -   Visual Options (to configure reader-specific visual options, such as font family, line height, paragraph spacing, etc.)
                    -   Control Options (to configure reader-specific control options, such as tap zones, swipe gestures, etc.)
                    -   Themes (to select a theme for the reader, can be set to application theme or reader-specific theme)
                    -   Sync to Cloud (future feature to allow syncing of the work to a cloud service for backup and synchronization across devices)
                    -   Sync from Cloud (future feature to allow syncing of the work from a cloud service for backup and synchronization across devices)
                    -   Check for Updates (to check for updates to the work)
    -   Updates: A page to view work update history
    -   History: A page to view a history of read works
    -   Browse: A top-tabbed page to navigate between the following:
        -   Sources: A page to view all sources in the application
            -   Clicking on a source will allow the user to browse works from that source
        -   Extensions: A page that in the future will (theoretically) allow the application to only ship with shared core functionality, and let additional features be added via extensions (similar to Tachiyomi/Mihon's extension system)
            -   Extensions will be able to add new sources, new eBook file formats, new features, etc.
        -   TBD, but is currently Migrate: A page to check for works that are cross-posted between sources (where one source might have more chapters than another) or authors that have accounts in different sources (where one source might have different works than another)
    -   More: A page to navigate to the following:
        -   Downloaded Only: A switch to toggle between showing only works/chapters that are downloaded in the library and all works/chapters attached to the configured sources/accounts/cloud backup
        -   Incognito Mode: A switch to toggle between saving user actions (such as reading history, bookmarks, highlights, etc.) and not saving them
        -   Download Queue: A page to view the current download queue
        -   Categories: A page to view configured categories for the library/searching
            -   A category is defined as a set of configured tags, languages, fandoms, etc. that will be used to filter works in the library
                -   Example: A filter for "My Hero Academia" works that are in English, include the "Midoriya Izuku/Uraraka Ochako" romantic pairing, and contain the "Midoriya Izuku Does Not Have One-for-All" tag
            -   Categories will be visible as tabs in the library page (if tabs are enabled in Library preferences) or in the library search screen
        -   Statistics: A page to view statistics about the user's library
            -   This will include:

The packages I'm currently using in the application include the following (feel free to recommend better alternatives if there are any, except where explicitly stated otherwise). Please look at my pubspec.yaml for any packages I haven't specified by name and their versions:

-   Riverpod: For state management
-   Isar: For database management
-   Freezed: For data classes and immutability
-   Flex Color Scheme: For theming and color management
-   Auto Route: For routing and navigation
-   Draggable Menu: For creating a resizable bottom sheet for the library sort/filter/display/tag options
-   Dio: For making HTTP requests
-   BeautifulSoup Dart: For parsing HTML content
-   Easy Refresh: What I'm currently using for vertical paging and vertical scrolling in the reader
-   (Formerly) Epubx: I was using epubx to parse EPUB files, but documentation on actually CREATING EPUB files with it is nonexistent, so I scrapped it in favor of writing my own EPUB file reading/writing logic using the archive package to read/write ZIP files and the xml package to read/write XML files
-   Flutter Local Notifications: For displaying notifications, haven't gotten a notification to display yet
-   Logger: For logging
-   RXDart: For reactive programming and streams

The application has a good amount of barebones functionality already implemented, but requires refining and simplification of the codebase. The current implementation uses Isar for database management, but I am looking to refactor the code to store only metadata in the database while keeping the actual content of the works in eBook files. This will allow for better performance and easier management of works. In the future, I would like to explore options for cloud backup and synchronization to allow for a fluid experience between devices (similar to how Chrome and Firefox allow tab syncing between devices), but for now, the focus will be on local storage and management.

My current objectives are the following:

-   Works

    -   Metadata
        -   Stored in the database
        -   Defined as:
            -   Title
            -   Author(s)
                -   Name
                -   URL (for linking to author pages)
            -   File Path (location of the eBook file)
            -   Last Read Position (to track where the user left off)
            -   Fandom(s)
                -   Name
                -   URL (for linking to fandom pages)
            -   List of Aliases
                -   An alias is a name that the fandom is known by, to correct parsed fandoms to the correct name
                    -   Example:
                        -   Fandom Name: "My Hero Academia"
                        -   Aliases:
                            -   "Boku no Hero Academia"
                            -   "MHA"
                            -   "BnHA"
                            -   "僕のヒーローアカデミア"
                        -   In this case, if the parser finds "Boku no Hero Academia", it will be corrected to "My Hero Academia"

                    -   Freeform
                        -   For tags that don't fit into the other categories
                        -   These are assorted tags that individual authors will add to their works arbitrarily
                -   URL (for linking to tag pages, if applicable)
                -   Related Tags

            -   List of Series
                -   Name

                -   It will be updated as the user reads
            -   List of Chapters
                -   Each chapter will have its own metadata
                -   This will allow for easy navigation and management of chapters
                -   Chapters will be stored in the eBook file as HTML strings, allowing for easy rendering in the application
                -   Chapter metadata will be pulled of work refreshes from the work URL, to be compared against the file
                -   New chapters (chapters that exist in the source and are copied to the database, but do not exist in the file) can be individually added to the download queue
    -   Content
        -   Stored in a file (EPUB, PDF, HTML, MOBI)
        -   The content should be readable by the application
            -   This will allow users to read the works directly from the application
            -   ReaderRoute will be used to display the content
        -   Content is saved as HTML strings in the eBook file
            -   This allows for easy rendering in the application

-   3rd-Party Connection
    -   Fanfiction update notifications are typically sent to email addresses as a notification email
    -   I would like some way to possibly hook in to an email account to send a push notification to the application when an applicable email is received
        -   This would require the user to grant permission to access their email account
        -   The application would need to securely store the user's email credentials
        -   The email service would send some notification or run some sort of cloud function when an email from a configured sender is received
            -   AO3: do-not-reply@archiveofourown.org
            -   FFN: bot@fanfiction.com
        -   Possibly use a service like IFTTT or Zapier to connect the email account to the application
            -   This would allow the application to receive notifications when an email is received from a configured sender
            -   The application would need to handle the notification and display it to the user
        -   Possibly use a Google email address and use the Gamil API and/or Firebase Cloud Functions to check for new emails
            -   This would allow the application to receive notifications when an email is received from a configured sender
            -   The application would need to handle the notification and display it to the user
        -   Possibly use a service like Firebase Cloud Messaging to send push notifications to the application when an email is received
            -   This would allow the application to receive notifications even when it is not running
            -   The application would need to handle the notification and display it to the user

I have a limited amount of time before I would like for the first version of the application to be functional (about a week), so I would like to prioritize the most important features and functionality first. The application is currently in a state where it can be used to read works (from the database stored content, NOT from files), so I would like to focus on refining the codebase and implementing the features that will allow users to manage their library of works effectively.

Given the previous information, I would like to ask for your help in the following areas:

-   Refactoring the codebase to simplify and improve the structure
-   Converting my existing approach to storing only metadata in the database while keeping the actual content in eBook files
-   Determining a plan of action for implementing the features and functionality described above
-   Providing guidance on best practices for implementing the features and functionality
